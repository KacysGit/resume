The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my programming skills and my dedication to learning. I was not taught how to do this in school. I took it upon myself to better understand website design by watching Visual Studio Code's youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srQjolk7rj8&t=287s&ab_channel=VisualStudioCode

I based my initial design off this video and then took the time to understand how it worked and evolved it into my own unique design.
