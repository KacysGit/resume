        <b> NASA High School Aerospace Scholar</b> <br>
        While in high school, I completed a four month long aerospace course. Each month would focus on science, 
        technology, engineering, or mathematics. At the end of the four months, I earned one of the highest grades which
        led NASA to pay for me to fly to the Johnson Space Center to partake in their 4 day long aerospace workshop.
        I worked with on a team with the help of NASA engineers to build a model of a land rover, lander, helmet,
        and space glove. The intention of each modeled item is for it to be used on Mars in the scenario that
        NASA finds a way to get a space craft that far.

        Conservation of wildlife and habitat is extremely important to me. There is an alarming amount of habitat being destroyed 
        all over the world. America alone has lost over half of its original wetland habitat. I have made 12 birdhouses for, 
        Prothonotary Warblers, a bird species nearing endangerment and monitor them every summer to remove any hazards. While this 
        helps, it is going to take effort from everyone in order to bring change or preservation of wildlife. I have published two 
        newspaper articles advocating for habitat conservation and have given six presentations about conservation projects and 
        small things members of communities can do to make a big difference. Three of these presentations were to my 4-H club.

        In 2020, our world suffered to a major crisis: the Corona Virus. Millions lost their lives, and millions more 
        lost their jobs. As corona was beginning to emerge in China, I led a project to collect food for the North Texas Food Bank and set 
        it up so my 4-H club could come volunteer with me at the North Texas Food Pantry to package donation boxes that are 
        sent to local families in need. At the end of the day, we had packed 525 boxes and a total of 8,596 meals.

        <b> Officer Positions</b> <br>
        <u> 4-H Vice President of Programs</u> <br>
        I held this position for a year. My job was to arrange guest speakers for our monthly meetings at my 4-H club. 
        In addition to this, I also set up two field trips. My club leader said that I was the best Vice President she had seen in
        the 7 years she was a leader for Legacy 4-H.
        <br> <u> THEO Private School Vice President of Service Projects</u> <br>
        As the Vice President of Service Projects, my job was to set up regular community service projects for my private school.
        I set up a food drive, a donation drive for a women's shelter, and pushed to buy a desk for one of the teachers who did 
        not have one and had been setting all her items on the floor. <br>
