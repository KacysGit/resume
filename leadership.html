        In 2020, our world suffered to a major crisis: the Corona Virus. Millions lost their lives, and millions more 
        lost their jobs. <br>
        As corona was beginning to emerge in China, I led a project to collect food for the North Texas Food Bank and set 
        it up so my 4-H club could come volunteer with me at the North Texas Food Pantry to package donation boxes that are 
        sent to local families in need. At the end of the day, we had packed 525 boxes and a total of 8,596 meals. <br>
